Scrum is a popular agile framework used in software development that emphasizes teamwork, accountability, and iterative progress toward a well-defined goal. What makes Scrum intriguing is its use of "sprints"â€”short, time-boxed periods where a team works on a set of tasks, allowing for rapid adaptation and frequent delivery of product increments. This approach not only enhances productivity but also promotes continuous improvement and early problem detection through regular reviews and retrospectives.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are essential metrics used to gauge the success of a business or project against set objectives. An interesting fact about KPIs is that they date back to the 18th century, when ship captains used navigational stars as performance measures to guide their voyages successfully. In modern times, companies like Google have revolutionized the use of KPIs by aligning them closely with objectives and key results (OKRs), enabling them to drive innovation and achieve significant milestones through measurable goals.

Sprints involve short, repetitive cycles of work, typically lasting one to four weeks. During a sprint, teams focus on completing predetermined tasks, often resulting in mundane routines.
